How to read these docs?
#######################

Flyte can be interacted with and operated in 3 ways, or by 3 personas:
**user**, **administrator**, and **contributor**. The documentation is
organized in a way so that the reading flow is optimized for each of these
personas.

User: I want to write Flyte Workflows
=====================================
A user refers to anyone who wants to:
  - Explore how Flyte works and try it out before installing, operating, or
    using it
  - Use a hosted Flyte deployment available at her organization
  - Deploy a local cluster for debugging or testing

Administrator: I want to manage a Flyte installation at my company
==================================================================
An administrator is someone who wants to:
  - deploy, manage, and scale a Flyte installation for their organization. 
  - The administrator is not interested in altering or modifying any code, only using the system off the shelf, and configuring the various available knobs and settings. 
  - This section also talks about the typical installation structure and scalability primitives available in the system.

Contributor: I want to help make Flyte even more awesome!
=========================================================
A contributor is someone who wants to:
   - Extend Flyte's capabilities by contributing new plugins
   - Fix a bug in the source code
   - Gain a deep understanding of Flyte's architecture
   - Add new functionality or alter the source code for their organization
   - Contribute to this documentation

We view Flyte enthusiasts as potential contributors and recommend they read
through these docs as well.
